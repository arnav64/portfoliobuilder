These files are taken from a project created by Arnav Joshi, Sarthak Jain, Anush Chheda and Daniel Ssemanda for a class on Databases and Information Systems.

We  created a website that stores data about startups sourced from Crunchbase in an AWS Database and allows users to search for different startups using
various filters. Users can then add the startups that they like to a Portfolio. We called the website an Investor Portfolio Builder.
